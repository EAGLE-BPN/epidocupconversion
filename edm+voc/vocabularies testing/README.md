SKOS Vocabularies transformations
==================

There are the EAGLE vocabularies of terms used in Epigraphy

The two transformations available can print each or all of these into

- a latex long table (to print these into a book or report)

- a tree of html files and corresponding skos tree

This is useful for those who use tematres to imput data but want to publish it with corresponding correct skos pointing to a complete skos tree.

Also it helps handling languages if your vocabulary is multilingual but does not use strictly the target vocabulary logic of tematres.
