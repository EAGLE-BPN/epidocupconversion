normalization to deal with precombined charachters.
normalize-unicode($textnfc, 'NFD')

space normalization. (check if necessary)


fix in EDR-epidoc the way numbers are handled to get the total value

<xsl:variable name="numbers" select="tokenize('50000 10000 10000')"/>
<xsl:value-of select="sum($numbers)"/>


restracture with xsl:import (?) so that indipendently functional bits aren't repeated
apply +modes and call



wishes
